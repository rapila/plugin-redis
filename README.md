# Redis caching strategy for rapila 1.5+

## Configuration

Add a configuration for the redis caching strategy to a config/caching.yml:

	strategies:
	â€¦
		redis:
			class: "CachingStrategyRedis"
			options:
				host: "fillme"
				port: 6379
				password: "fillme"

Use the strategies for the modules you want:

	modules:
		templates: "redis"

Or use it for all modules (except images, which has to be overridden explicitly):

	modules:
		_default: "redis"
